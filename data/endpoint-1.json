Because it sounds smart without being helpful at all. Every piece of wood has a bear. Even after you make paper out of it. Which is why a better title might be: \"Build yer bear (A workshop)\"\n\n\n\nWriter's block is when you can't \"see the bear\". It happens to everybody. Your brilliant idea disappears as soon as you try to share. To find/build your bear, we will be writing, moving around, making funny noises (besides \"aaaargh\"), and stretching metaphors. \n\n\n\nAges 10+ will get the most benefit, adults are welcome to audit.\n\n\n\nPlease bring whatever you are most comfortable writing on. (Phone, laptop, tablet, paper, cuniform...) At the bare minimum, participants will have to bear with some truly grizzly ursanine puns. Although they can be polarizing, they are the true sign of koality. Which is actually a marsupial. Panda?",

This comprehensive workshop takes you on a journey through three interconnected approaches to algorithmic problem-solving: Dynamic Programming as a foundational technique for optimal decision-making, Genetic Algorithms for evolving solutions to complex optimization problems, and Bio-inspired Algorithms like Firefly and Ant Colony for tackling challenging search spaces.\n\n\n\nThrough hands-on examples and practical implementations, you'll learn how to identify which algorithm suits different types of problems, implement these techniques in your language of choice, and analyze the tradeoffs of each approach. We'll progress from implementing basic Dynamic Programming solutions to building self-improving systems with Genetic Algorithms and finally explore how nature-inspired algorithms can solve problems that traditional approaches struggle with.\n\n\n\nYou'll leave with a powerful toolbox of algorithmic techniques, practical implementation knowledge, and the ability to apply these approaches to real-world optimization, search, and decision-making problems in your own systems. Whether you're building resource schedulers, network optimizers, or automated decision engines, these battle-tested algorithms will give you new ways to tackle complex problems elegantly and efficiently.",

Instead, we will jump in quickly and build infrastructure in AWS. Then we’ll change it, tear it down, and bring up new cloud resources, all with Terraform and Terragrunt code. Quizzes and exercises abound.\n\nWe’ll start with some basic steps to get familiar with the Terraform lifecycle. Then we will expand our environment with variables, outputs, data, loops, and conditionals. We will learn some tools to help us use Terraform safely and securely. We'll finish by adding some flexibility and extra control with Terragrunt.\n\nThis is a hands-on workshop. You’ll need a laptop with a browser. We will work in an online environment (AWS Cloud9) to limit prerequisites and setup issues. \n\n",

      "description": "In years past, we've trained mad scientists by using Raspberry Pi's, electronics, and Python to build sharks with freakin' laser beams in our quest for global domination.  However, we've realized our goal to be overlords of earth were not maniacal enough!  So, this year our sights are much higher.  Using Raspberry Pi Pico microcontrollers, Python, electric motors, 3D printed parts, and your ingenuity, you will construct a rover ready to conquer mars! This vehicle will be capable of traversing rough surfaces like those of the red planet and will be programmable to handle out of this world challenges.  Remember those mechanical sharks with freakin' lasers on their heads?  Well HONEY WE BLEW UP THE SHARKS and will be using those shark parts to transform these rovers into the ULTIMATE MAD SCIENTIST vehicles to fend off any threats you may encounter in this extra-planetary conquest.\n\nOnce you've built your functioning JAWS Rover in our lab, if you choose, you will have the opportunity to battle test your vehicle against other rovers to see who's design reigns supreme! Join us in this epic quest and learn to meld software and hardware together to accomplish our goal of bringing Sharks to Mars!\n\n\n\nA ticket for this Pre-compiler will entitle you to a kit that includes a Raspberry Pi Pico and the hardware to build a rover that will be yours to keep. You may also bring a lab assistant to help with the assembly and programming (one kit per ticket though!).  Accomplished mad scientists will be in the lab to guide you through the build process.  We will also have stretch goals and challenges for those with previous experience or fast learners.  Come join us for this out of the world fun and learning for all levels!",

Models can be sent to the 3D printer lab where we will make our best effort to get student models printed!\n\n\n\nPLEASE NOTE: High School aged teens or late junior high aged students may also attend adult sessions. Additionally, kids that complete all kid projects in the morning sessions without issue are welcome in this lab as we will be making slightly more advanced models that are different.",

We have some additional options to expand model building skills for those who have been through our previous sessions.\n\n\n\nWe are offering a deeper dive into the process of making jewelry with CAD and 3D printing. We will go over a brief presentation about various ways of making jewelry from CAD models and then we will transition into a more advanced free form Rhino model-building walk-through session to build a pendant that would work for casting. These models can be printed out on our resin printers.\n\n\n\nOpen to anyone (kids or adults) who have gone through the regular introductory sessions. PLEASE NOTE this session assumes you have taken the basic overview classes OR are reasonably comfortable working in Rhino3D.\n\n\n\nAfter we get some of the models printed, we plan to offer a tech demo of the process of using Delft Clay to make an impression from the 3D models. \n\n\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This is a session that is likely to have both kid and adult attendees. If your child has attended the introductory class and is looking for a chance to make something more complex, they are welcome in this class. It is likely best for High School aged teens or late junior high aged students, but any kid that has completed the introductory class without issue and is able to follow a slightly faster paced class may also attend.\n\n",

From embedding layers to attention mechanisms, you'll gain a thorough understanding of how these models process and predict tokens. This foundation sets the stage for understanding both the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in practical applications.\n\n\n\nBuilding on this knowledge, we'll dive into the mathematical foundations of embeddings, one of the most powerful yet misunderstood tools in the LLM ecosystem. You'll learn how to leverage various comparison techniques like Cosine similarity and clustering to create sophisticated applications that go beyond basic chat interfaces. Through hands-on examples, you'll discover how to transform raw text into meaningful vector representations that capture semantic relationships.\n\n\n\nThe workshop culminates with an in-depth exploration of RAG systems, demonstrating how to combine the pre-trained knowledge of LLMs with your own data sources. Using C# and the Microsoft OpenAI Client, we'll implement practical RAG solutions that address real business challenges. You'll learn strategies for managing request complexity, ensuring retrieval accuracy, handling model biases, and validating response authenticity.\n\n\n\nBy the end of this workshop, you'll possess a comprehensive understanding of LLM technology, from theoretical foundations to practical implementation. Whether you're building content generation systems, or information retrieval solutions, you'll be equipped with the knowledge and tools to harness these technologies responsibly and effectively in your applications.",

We will focus on the process of using CAD to create our model with a NURBS modeler called Rhino3D and will walk through the UI and how Rhino uses basic curves and shapes to create more advanced geometry and create basic models like a goblet, and or a challenge coin. Models can be sent to the 3D printer lab where we will make our best effort to get student models printed!\n\n\n\nPLEASE NOTE: High School aged teens or late junior high aged students may also attend adult sessions. Additionally, kids that complete all kid projects in the morning sessions without issue are welcome in this lab as we will be making slightly more advanced models that are different.",

We will be using a variety of model techniques to produce a model car that resembles a real race car and then print it out on the lab’s advanced resin printers. While this session will repeat, the idea will be that attendees are welcome to come to both race league sessions and make different cars or continue working on tuning the model into a super car!\n\n\n\nOpen to anyone (kids or adults) who have gone through the regular introductory sessions. PLEASE NOTE this session assumes you have taken the basic overview classes OR are reasonably comfortable working in Rhino3D.\n\n\n\nWe will have some track pieces at the lab to test and possibly race the cars once we get them built! \n\n\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This is a session that is likely to have both kid and adult attendees. If your child has attended the introductory class and is looking for a chance to make something more complex, they are welcome in this class. It is likely best for High School aged teens or late junior high aged students, but any kid that has completed the introductory class without issue and is able to follow a slightly faster paced class may also attend.",

      "description": "As web apps scale and user expectations rise, the race to faster load times is more critical than ever. Lazy loading has become the go-to strategy to speed up perceived performance—but not all lazy loading is created equal. Under the hood, each major frontend framework tackles this challenge differently, with varying levels of control, complexity, and tradeoffs.\n\n\n\nThis workshop dives into how React, Angular, and Vue implement lazy loading—revealing not just what works, but why it works (or doesn’t) in real-world scenarios. We'll break down the internals behind code splitting, route-based loading, dynamic imports, and module boundaries, showing how these design choices shape everything from time-to-interactive to dev experience and long-term scalability.\n\n\n\nYou’ll learn how code splitting, lazy loading, and parallel builds aren’t just nice-to-haves—they’re performance multipliers hiding in plain sight and you'll get hands-on with each. We’ll dive into practical strategies to restructure your app for speed, uncover surprising bottlenecks, and show how small architectural shifts can yield surprising gains for both users and developers. For those chasing faster load times and shorter feedback loops, this talk is your blueprint.\n\n\n\nWhether you're picking a new frontend stack or trying to squeeze every millisecond out of your current one, this session will help you make smarter, framework-aware architectural decisions based on actual data.",

      "description": "This talk describes building web applications focused on hypermedia, an approach that differs significantly from the SPA frameworks popular today such as React and Angular.\n\n\n\nToday, web apps typically use client-side JavaScript code to send HTTP requests to server endpoints that query/update databases and return JSON data. The client code then transforms JSON into an HTML presentation.\n\n\n\nThis is not what Roy Fielding had in mind when he wrote his famous dissertation \"Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures\" that gave birth to REST.\n\n\n\nHTMX is a small client-side JavaScript library that adds support for new HTML attributes. These enable responding to specific interactions (ex. click) with any HTML element by sending an HTTP request using any verb. The response must contain HTML. Rather than performing a complete page refresh, the returned HTML replaces an existing DOM element or is inserted relative to one.\n\n\n\nThis approach removes the need to serialize data to JSON on the server, parse JSON on the client, and convert it to HTML. It also simplifies state management because all state can reside only on the server.\n\n\n\nThe server can be implemented using any programming language and server framework. While HTMX itself is implemented in JavaScript, HTMX enables writing complete web applications without authoring any JavaScript code.\n\n\n\nTopics covered will include:\n\n\n\n- Introduction to htmx\n\n- Choosing a tech stack\n\n- Example htmx app\n\n- Pros and cons\n\n- Frequently used htmx attributes\n\n- Out-of-band swaps\n\n- Input validation\n\n- Lazy loading\n\n- Active search\n\n- Infinite scroll\n\n- Alpine\n\n- Resources",

Some are crisp, clear, and make me want to schedule an interview before I finish reading. Others? Let’s just say they require a decoder ring, a magnifying glass, and a strong cup of coffee.\n\nThe truth is: your resume is your first impression, and if it makes my job easier, you’re already ahead of the game. If it makes me squint, scroll, or sigh… well, you might be silently voted off the island.\n\nIn this session, we’ll break down what separates the “easy yes” resumes from the ones that get buried in the maybe pile. We’ll talk about what hiring managers actually look for, what signals seniority, and how to avoid the most common resume missteps. Expect real examples, candid advice, and maybe a few resume horror stories (names changed to protect the guilty).\n\nWhether you’re polishing your own resume or coaching others, this conversation will help you write like someone who knows their worth—and makes it easy for others to see it too.",

      "description": "Tired of smart home devices that need the internet to turn on a light bulb? Fed up with voice assistants that mishear \"dim the bedroom\" as \"order three tons of cat food\"? This session explores how to create a truly intelligent home automation system using Ollama for local AI processing and MQTT for reliable device communication. We'll examine how a custom MCP (Model Context Protocol) server translates natural language commands into MQTT messages, letting you control Z-Wave devices, smart switches, and sensors through conversational AI that runs entirely on your local network. Unlike corporate voice assistants that maintain corporate politeness, your local AI can have personality – imagine an assistant that responds to \"turn off all the lights\" with \"Finally going to bed at a reasonable hour? Impressive.\" or sarcastically comments when you ask it to turn the heat up for the third time today.\n\n\n\nWe'll explore how this architecture bridges AI understanding and IoT device control, turning \"make the living room cozy for movie night\" into precise MQTT commands thatcoordinate multiple devices. The session covers integration patterns with popular platforms like Home Assistant and Z-Wave JS, examines Home Assistant's remarkable progress through their Year of Voice initiative (including their recent achievements in local voice processing), and demonstrates how structured prompting creates reliable device control while maintaining the personality you actually want in your home. No cloud dependencies, no monthly subscriptions, and definitely no corporate eavesdropping on your late-night snack requests – just a working example of how local AI can make your smart home both intelligent and entertaining.",

The secret sauce is vector embeddings and similarity search – technologies that convert complex data (text, images, audio) into high-dimensional numerical representations that capture semantic meaning. While traditional databases excel at exact matches (\"find user ID 12345\"), vector databases revolutionize \"find similar\" queries by measuring relationships between these numerical vectors using techniques like cosine similarity. This session demystifies the math and technology behind the AI-powered search and recommendation systems you use every day.\n\n\n\nYou'll discover how companies transform words into vectors where \"king\" - \"man\" + \"woman\" actually equals \"queen\" in mathematical space, explore the architecture behind popular vector databases like Pinecone and see live demonstrations of building semantic search systems. We'll cover real-world applications from RAG-powered chatbots to fraud detection, show you how to implement document similarity search in 20 lines of Python, and discuss the practical considerations of scaling vector systems to billions of embeddings. Whether you're building recommendation engines, semantic search, or AI-powered applications, this session provides the foundational knowledge to leverage vector databases effectively in your projects.",

Install the old SDK/framework versions? Can they even be installed at the same time on the same machine?  What if I told you there was a way to accomplish this with little to no effort on your part?  Well, with Visual Studio Code, Docker, and the Dev Containers extension, you can.  Dev containers can help you easily on-board new people to your projects, allow for cleaner machines with greater support for multiple SDKs/Framework, and be able to develop/debug/run your solution from anywhere without Visual Studio Code. Oh, and put an end to \"It works on my machine\"\n\n\n\nIn this talk, I’ll walk through how you can set up a dev container to support your application development, without installing the SDK/framework on your machine. I’ll show you how to get started and how you can solve the age-old problem of “It works on my machine!”.  As a bonus, if your code is hosted on GitHub, I’ll show you how you can run/edit/debug your project right from GitHub.com without Visual Studio Code on your machine.\n\n",

You'll explore Mayer-Salovey's Four-Branch Ability Model (focusing on emotional problem-solving skills), Bar-On's EQ-i 2.0 Mixed Model (emphasizing 15 competencies across five domains), and Goleman's Workplace Competency Model (targeting performance-based emotional skills). Recognizing the strengths and blind spots of each framework, you’ll learn when to apply ability-based versus competency-based approaches, and will walk away with a customizable EQ development roadmap and coaching tools to turn everyday workplace challenges into catalyst moments for emotional intelligence growth.",

      "description": "Building interactive systems with conventional coding means trying to anticipate every possible user action and writing the right response. This quickly becomes nigh impossible. You end up lost in a maze of recursion, fragility, and nested if statements. The more interactive you make your system, the more complex your code gets, until debugging feels like being eaten by a grue—you know something's wrong, but you're just fumbling around in the dark.\n\n\n\nThere's a better way. Instead of scripting every interaction, we can give some of the elements in our system their own intelligence. Multi-agent collaboration lets us create systems where entities can become autonomous agents with their own perspectives and voices. Imagine a text-based adventure game where the brass lantern, the white house, and even the mailbox have something to say when responding to the player. Or consider a help desk system where agents from billing, technical support, and account management each weigh in to determine the best solution for a customer.\n\n\n\nIn this session, we'll explore multi-agent collaboration through a live demo of a text-based adventure system. You'll meet the orchestration workflow—router, classifier, agents, arbiter, and committer—and discover how LangGraph.js coordinates the chaos when multiple agents want to respond. We'll shine our brass lantern over the code to see how it uses Redis and LangGraph.js to make it all work. Then, we'll explore how this same approach solves real-world problems beyond gaming.\n\n\n\nWhen the adventure's over, you'll understand how to coordinate agents to handle complex interactions and know when this is a good approach. You'll have a working example you can adapt for your own adventures—be they exploring the Great Underground Empire, customer service platforms, or content management systems. And, you'll never look at building interactive systems the same way again.",

      "description": "Ever watched AI coding agents churn out features in minutes, only to realize your codebase is quietly unraveling into a maintenance nightmare? That is the double-edged sword we are wielding today, and when managers and CEOs just care about outcomes this speed-over-craft mindset becomes a ticking time bomb.\n\n\n\nIn this talk, I share lessons from a recent engagement where I was tasked with using AI agents to “vibe code” a legacy application into a modern React front end. The goal was not just delivery, but to push the boundaries of the software development lifecycle and uncover the friction points: where humans and machines clash, where prompts fall short, and whether the outcome in time and money would actually be better, worse, or about the same.\n\n\n\nAlong the way, some patterns began to emerge. Besides a long list of “do not do this” rules, I also found a few practices that held things together, such as reducing duplication, creating clear boundaries in the system, and keeping things simple. These habits acted as anchors in the middle of machine-generated chaos, proving that even when code is written by agents, architecture is still the difference between entropy and endurance. That is why architecture matters now more than ever!\n\n",

      "description": "Meetings are so notorious for draining productivity that historic sabotage manuals listed them as a tactic of choice. The trouble is, modern meetings often fall into the same traps by accident: too many people invited, vague agendas, and decisions that never stay decided. The result isn’t just a wasted hour, but a feedback loop: too many meetings leave no time to prepare, which makes meetings run longer, which forces multitasking, which makes them even less effective.\n\n\n\nIn this talk, we show how to break those feedback loops before they start. Using lessons lifted from the old sabotage playbook, we’ll contrast common anti-patterns with practical counter-moves: picking the right type of meeting, deciding who actually needs to be there, shaping the environment and logistics, and closing with action and accountability. The aim is simple: meetings that respect time and deliver outcomes. Or, to misquote Arleen Lorrance, be the meeting you want to see happen.\n\n\n\nLearning outcomes\n\n* Spot and break meeting feedback loops\n\n* Apply countermeasures to sabotage anti-patterns\n\n* Choose the right meeting type and environment\n\n* Use deliberate prep to respect time and attention",

This approach not only accelerates load times regardless of application size but also strengthens security by preventing unnecessary source files from being downloaded. The result is a streamlined development process that supports rapid MVP releases while maintaining the flexibility to grow into robust enterprise-grade solutions without costly rewrites.",

Fast forward over 20 years later and Ruby on Rails 8.0 is here with Full-Stack Flexing to the next level!\n\n\n\nPaired with ActiveRecord (Since Ruby on Rails 1.0!) that makes working with a database so easy it's an afterthought, Ruby on Rails 8.0 adds the trifecta of SolidQueue, SolidCache and SolidCable removing the need for Redis altogether. Queuing of jobs, caching to speed up your web application and using pub/sub WebSocket communication straight out of the box.\n\n\n\nAdd in other Full-Stack building blocks such as Propshaft for your asset pipeline, Kamal 2.0 for easy deployments and a built-in Authentication Generator, Ruby on Rails 8.0 enables you to go from \"Hello World to IPO\" with the best One-Person Framework out there.\n\n\n\nJoin this session to learn (or re-learn!) just what an amazing web framework Ruby on Rails 8.0 is and how this technology and community have thrived in the over 20 years it's been together. Find out why the Ruby and Rails community is so passionate about the technology, but even more important are the people that continue to enjoy writing code that makes you smile.",

Then the difference between machine language and assembly language is explained.  Next is learning a 20 or so instructions in a simple machine language, the machine language of the 6502 microprocessor that was used in the Apple II, Atari and Commodore computers.  \n\n\n\nSimple programs will be presented and executed on an online Apple II simulator and a real, live, vintage Apple //c computer.

Now that Ivy is complete, we are seeing significant changes to improve the developer experience and to add innovative capabilities.\n\n\n\nThere have been many major improvements in Angular 16 through 21, and we'll cover signals, standalone components, deferrable views, new control flow, and more.\n\n\n\nCome to this talk to learn how Angular is leaping forward to make your development life easier.",

They are a very powerful tool, especially with the async/await syntactic sugar.\n\n\n\nBut limitations in promises opened the door to observables and their associated operator functions. They are much more powerful than promises overall, but can also be much more confusing.\n\n\n\nSignals are yet another approach, one that has gained a lot of attention since Angular adopted them in 2023, but it solves completely different problems.\n\n\n\nNow we have three different reactive primitives. Why? What's the difference between them? Why would you choose one over the other? Or will they all have complementary roles in a modern JavaScript/TypeScript application?\n\n\n\nCome to this session to get the answers to these questions, and more!",

However, as any adventurer knows, these powerful technologies can also introduce challenges akin to facing a rogue dragon—unexpected behavior and complex troubleshooting. \n\n\n\nIn this talk, we’ll explore how to harness the benefits of AI/ML solutions while maintaining control and minimizing unpredictability. We’ll use observability through OpenTelemetry and Aspire as our magic map to gain insights into the labyrinth of AI orchestration systems using frameworks like Semantic Kernel or Microsoft.Extensions.AI. We'll see how you can define and orchestrate a tapestry of AI systems and evaluate their performance using Semantic Kernel's Process and Agents Frameworks, AI Evaluation and reporting, and plain old data analytics to deliver a high quality solo table top roleplaying game experience.\n\n\n\nWhile the topic is fun, the challenges of optimizing and troubleshooting AI systems is one many teams know all too well. Thankfully, modern advances in evaluation, orchestration, and observability can help stop your application or virtual game master from going chaotic evil on you - or your users.",

But in reality, a gradual migration, done one piece at a time, is not only possible, it's actually the smarter way to go.\n\n\n\nIn this workshop, we'll walk you through what it really takes to pull off a migration like this without disrupting your team or your product. We’ll look at some of the common challenges you’ll run into like dealing with two different routing systems, keeping state consistent across frameworks, and managing bundle size when both frameworks need to live side by side for a while.\n\n\n\nWe'll wrap up by getting hands-on with practical strategies that have worked well in real-world projects, including patterns like the Strangler Fig. The goal is to provide a realistic and replicable path forward so you can modernize your app, reduce tech debt, and end up with a cleaner, more maintainable codebase all without grinding your velocity.",

They’ll generate code with confidence, validate it with tests they wrote themselves (if any), celebrate with a lot of emojis, and call it a job well done.\n\n\n\nThis talk introduces a working model for AI-assisted development that actually holds up under real-world use. It’s built on three ideas:\n\n\n\n- The Chasm: the dangerous gap between what we meant and what we asked for.\n\n\n\n- The Craft: the human skill to spot when AI gets it “technically right” but still wrong.\n\n\n\n- The Chain: the Intent Integrity Chain, a structured flow of prompt → spec → test → code, where each output is validated externally, by humans or deterministic systems, but never by the same model that generated it.\n\n\n\nAnd what we end up with is a blueprint for building production-ready software with AI, without sacrificing trust or intent.\n\n\n\nTrust your knowledge.\n\nTrust your tests.\n\nNever trust a monkey.",

Instead, we operate in an increasingly tangled web of services, platforms, and environments—on-prem, in the cloud, or both. In this complex landscape, how can we:\n\n\n\nUnderstand system load in real time?\n\nDetect whether a recent deploy is causing instability?\n\nCatch bottlenecks and errors before customers report them?\n\nMap internal issues directly to customer impact?\n\n\n\nThis is where observability—and specifically OpenTelemetry—comes in. But adopting observability practices isn’t plug-and-play. There's a learning curve and a lot of choices to navigate.\n\n\n\nIn this session, we’ll demystify observability through the lens of OpenTelemetry, covering:\n\n\n\nWhat observability really means (and why it matters)\n\nThe core signals: logs, metrics, and traces\n\nHow to instrument applications using OpenTelemetry SDKs and auto-instrumentation\n\nThe OpenTelemetry Collector: how it works, and how to build powerful telemetry pipelines\n\nReal-world use cases showing how to solve tricky production problems using telemetry\n\n\n\nAll examples will use free and open-source tools, so you’ll leave equipped to experiment and learn without vendor lock-in. By the end of the session, you’ll have a clear picture of the OpenTelemetry ecosystem and practical insights to begin (or improve) your own observability journey.",

      "description": "If you talk to the most well-known developers, whether they’re people within your organization or internationally recognized experts, you’ll find something in common: they’re productive. Usually, it isn’t just dumb luck. More often than not, they’ve focused on becoming more productive.\n\n\n\nThere are dozens of methodologies that claim to increase productivity, but there’s a clear winner amongst highly productive software developers: Getting Things Done (GTD). GTD, originally described in productivity guru David Allen’s best seller of the same title, describes a set of behaviors which, when followed regularly, reduce stress and help you become more productive at the same time.\n\n\n\nThis session looks at how programmers, architects, and technical managers can apply GTD principles to improve the productivity of individuals and the group as a whole. In addition to discussing the core principles of GTD, this session also examines tools which can be used to implement the methodology, as well as similarities to agile software development practices.\n\n",

But what happens when you need to modify, expand, share, or overhaul that API once it is already live in production?\n\n\n\nIn this talk, we’ll explore the real-world challenges we faced as our web APIs evolved over several years. We’ll discuss how initial decisions and insufficient planning led us into pitfalls, resulting in tech debt and obstacles when it came time to evolve our APIs.\n\n\n\nBy addressing design concerns like a well-documented API specification, versioning, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), an API gateway, and enhanced observability, we can avoid future rework and minimize disruption for our customers. Join us to learn strategies for navigating the complexities of evolving APIs and ensuring a smoother path from inception to long-term success.",

      "description": "The networks we use every day depend on centralized infrastructure that's vulnerable to censorship, surveillance, and single points of failure. Whether it's disasters, deliberate interference, or plain old downtime, entire populations can, in an instant, be cut off from digital communication—sometimes when they need it most. The heart of the problem is hierarchy—the hierarchical structure of these networks makes them easy to exploit or to simply shut down.\n\n\n\nReticulum is one solution to this problem. It's a cryptography-based networking stack that flattens the hierarchy entirely. It was built for creating resilient, ad hoc, and private networks using almost any communication hardware you can imagine—from LoRa, WiFi, and Ethernet to old school packet radio and serial ports. Whether you're dealing with natural disasters or just want communications that can't be easily disrupted, Reticulum is a powerful tool for building independent, interconnectable networks that work without central points of control.\n\n\n\nThis talk will break down what Reticulum is and dig into how the protocol works—from its clever addressing tricks to its baked-in encryption. We'll explore the built-in utilities that ship with Reticulum; try out apps like MeshChat, NomadNet, and Sideband for communication; and even show some code and learn how to build apps of our own.\n\n\n\nBy the end, you'll understand how Reticulum and the applications that run on it work and how to set it all up for yourself. Plus, you'll have the knowledge to grow the network and its capabilities by writing with applications of your own. But most importantly, you'll walk away understanding how to build communication networks that can survive disasters, resist interference, and keep working when traditional infrastructure fails.",

However, all the design happened in Figma, and now, you have to bring it to life in code – without the right tools, there is a huge chasm rife with possibilities of failure.\n\n\n\nThankfully, .NET developers do have well engineered tools to bring Figma goodness over – with high fidelity that honors the design. Be it for web, native or hybrid .NET apps, Figma Plugins can import design elements and provide developers with a great starting point – how cool is it to get customizable CSS or XAML/C# code directly from Figma designs? Moreover, developers get access to design surfaces to fine tune UI layout, alignment, spacing, behaviors and other design details – perfection needs eye for detail down the last pixel.

      "description": "Is your codebase fragile, where one small change risks breaking something unexpected? That fragility often comes from layered or “lasagna” architectures that scatter logic across controllers, services, repositories, and models. Touching one feature means touching several layers, and every change feels slow and risky. Vertical Slice Architecture takes a different approach.\n\n\n\nInstead of organizing by technical layer, it organizes by feature. Each slice contains everything it needs, from input to persistence, and stands largely on its own. This makes features easier to find, easier to understand, and easier to change without worrying about unintended ripple effects. It also gives you the freedom to pick the right implementation for each case, whether that means EF Core, Dapper, or raw SQL.\n\n\n\nIn this talk, we will explore how to shift from rigid layered designs to feature-oriented slices, and how that shift creates codebases that grow more naturally and stay easier to maintain. Through practical .NET examples, you will see how vertical slicing encourages clarity, flexibility, and confidence when building or refactoring applications. Layers might be fine for lasagna, but your architecture deserves something better.",

      "description": "It's a fact of life that we often have to write automated tests for features that have defects, or that interact with 3rd party APIs that aren't returning the right responses, or for items that we know aren't working right.  When the team has decided that the behavior isn't going to be fixed, what's an automation engineer to do?  Let the tests fail?  Not write them? Champion harder for the defects?\n\n\n\nI suggest writing your tests to pass and setting them up to fail.\n\n\n\nBy creating tests that pass on the current expected behavior (the defect), we are in a perfect position to tell when the defect is resolved, or the api is returning the correct information, or any of the other error cases we may be encountering.  This prevents failure fatigue (from seeing a test 'always fail), while still providing meaningful, actionable information out of our test suite.\n\n\n\nWe will discuss several cases that I've experienced that this method has worked for as well as how to keep the rest of the team informed through TODOs, Jira stories, and documentation.  And--of course!--what to do when your test finally fails.",

We’ll look at practical steps—like energy-efficient tools, leaner software, greener data centers, and responsible hardware lifecycles—that cut waste and costs while strengthening defenses. Just as importantly, we’ll examine how unstable supply chains, poor sourcing, or unreliable power can become security risks in themselves.\n\n\n\nWe’ll also connect this to risk and compliance: how building sustainability into security reduces exposure, steadies supply chains, and keeps organizations ahead of changing expectations. With real-world examples, you’ll walk away with a clear sense of how sustainability and security reinforce each other, and how to apply that thinking in your own work.\n\n",

      "description": "What if you could retrofit your car with driver-assist capabilities once reserved for luxury vehicles? Comma.ai’s openpilot project has made that vision real: an open-source advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) that anyone can experiment with. By pairing off-the-shelf hardware with neural networks running at the edge, Comma.ai has created a platform where hackers, engineers, and researchers can push the boundaries of vehicle automation outside of the closed OEM ecosystem.\n\n\n\nIn this session, we’ll explore how openpilot works under the hood. We’ll walk through the core components — from the Comma 3X hardware with its camera and sensors, to the CAN bus integration that allows reading and sending steering and throttle commands, to the perception and planning loops that keep the car centered and adaptive on highways. We’ll also highlight the critical role of driver monitoring, showing how computer vision ensures the human remains engaged and in control.\n\n\n\nWe’ll then look at the open-source ecosystem that powers innovation. The openpilot community trains and refines models, crowdsources driving data, and reverse-engineers vehicle signals to expand compatibility. This collaborative approach has created one of the most advanced community-driven ADAS platforms available today, and it opens the door for research into new safety and autonomy features that OEMs may not prioritize.\n\n\n\nFinally, we’ll dive into what’s next: training openpilot for advanced behaviors such as recognizing and reacting to stop signs, or detecting an incapacitated driver. We’ll cover what it takes to collect and label the right data, the challenges of training models for real-time edge deployment, and how these features integrate into the planning stack to ensure safety. We’ll close with the ethical and regulatory questions that arise when extending autonomy in open-source form — and how developers can contribute responsibly to making cars smarter, safer, and more accessible.",

Along the way, we pushed ourselves further: every line of code came from an AI model.\n\n\n\nThe journey started with staffing. As the company grew, managers lost track of who knew what and who was available. The agent bridged structured data with soft knowledge, surfacing options without replacing human judgment. From there, it stretched into other domains: CRM queries, analytics over a data lake, and lightweight business intelligence.\n\n\n\nKeeping the experiment honest meant instrumenting everything. We used dashboards to track cost and usage, traces to debug the agent’s thought process, and LLM-as-judge evals to measure and score the output. Human approval gates gave us confidence where the risks were higher.\n\n\n\nThis talk shares the case study- here we started, what we built, and what we learned- so you can apply the same lessons to your own agents before they get stuck in the prototype graveyard.\n\n\n\nLearning outcomes:\n\n- Evaluate where agents provide value, and where they won’t\n\n- Design agents that bridge messy data, planning, and human judgment\n\n- Test agent behavior with quantitative data and LLM-as-judge evaluation frameworks\n\n- Combine instrumentation, governance, and data engineering into sustainable AI systems",

In this Dive, we go back to the beginnings with the early sciences of photography to make cool prints with UV light! You will learn about one of the founding fathers of photography, and make prints using the process he invented, the cyanotype! You will also learn how to make other types of sunshine prints at home with other processes, none of which require a darkroom or a printer. ",

Children must have a responsible adult present. \n\n\n\nWe will talk about and watch videos about the exciting world of 3D printing. We will tour the 3D printer lab and look at the printers as well as models made on them We will also go over basics of how to make models and different types of CAD apps including some that are free or more kid friendly as well as looking at more professional apps as well. We’ll also discuss where to get free models and where to print them. This is the basic overview. Kids should start with this session before using the lab or doing the follow-up modeling course.",

We will explain the XYZ coordinate system, and what the different views are for. We will also spend some time playing with the transform functions. This session is best for kids with basic skills in measurement, elementary-level geometry, and basic computer skills. The session is probably most appropriate for children over 8 but all are welcome based on the child’s capabilities and ability to enjoy. The goal of the session will be to create a cup model we can print for the student.\n\n\n\nLess confident or younger kids are welcome to pair up with parents or siblings and just watch the parent/sibling. Kids that complete the kid’s projects without issue are welcome in the adult walk-through labs as they will be making slightly more advanced models that are different.\n\n\n\nPLEASE NOTE: We have a fairly large number of printers in the lab so our kids can possibly print items they make in class. If your child completes a model, we will be able to produce a screen render if desired or we will make our best efforts to print at least one model per student, based on demand.",

I have a B.S. in Electrical & Computer Engineering from UAH. a A.S. General Education Psychology (December 2025). I am also pursuing a degree in Communication Studies. I approach every presentation I create as if it were a TED talk. Just presenting information is not enough. The information is useless to the audience unless it is presented clearly. And for any learning to occur, the audience must be paying attention. To get the information across to the listeners, I make may presentations interesting. I do this with what I say, but also with how I say it: voice, gestures, humor, stories, props, etc. My presentation slides are also designed to clearly present information and keep the audience interested. I use contemporary presentation techniques such as those taught by Nancy Duarte in Slideology and Garr Reynolds in Presentation Zen. MANAGER As a manager, I manage projects and developers. I like managing projects, but on the technical side, not just the “update task list progress” side. As part of my job as a project manager, I improved my projects process by including version control, bug tracking, continuous integration, coding standards and other software engineering techniques. I also learned and practiced leadership in Toastmasters International as a club officer and as the District Public Relations Manager for 2015-2016. DEVELOPER I have 35 years of development experience in a variety of languages, development platforms and technical areas. I have experience in object-oriented analysis, design, and programming in C++, C♯ and about a dozen other languages. My experience includes embedded software, algorithm development, hardware interfaces, motion control, TCP/IP, desktop & web applications and databases SPEAKER I also have training and experience in communication and leadership. In 2009, I joined SAIC Toastmasters as a charter member. Through Toastmasters I have learned and practiced public speaking. I have competed in many speech contests including the semifinals of the 2013 Toastmasters World Championship of Public Speaking (WCPS). I have combined my technical knowledge, experiences as a manager and skills as a public speaker to create and give presentations to various groups. I have spoken on Software Engineering, Communication, Leadership and Career topics. Because of my diverse background, I particularly enjoy teaching “soft skills” such as communication and leadership to technical people. Some presentations I have given: * See Your Data on the Network with Wireshark (Workshop), CodeMash, January 2018 * See Your Data on the Network with Wireshark, Devspace, October 2017 * How to Create a Resume That Will Get You an Interview and What to Say When You Get It, Dog Food Conference, October 2017 * Be a Presenter People Want to Listen To, Dog Food Conference, October 2017 * How to Create a Resume That Will Get You an Interview and What to Say When You Get It, Music City Code, June 2017 * Leadership Lessons from Your Brain, Devspace, October 2016 * A Practical Approach to Software Engineering, BizTech: Hack U, April 2015 * Commencement Address, ITT Technical Institute, March 2012 * Leadership Lessons from Your Brain, Youth Leadership Conference, October 2013 * A Practical Approach to Software Engineering, North Alabama Web Developers, June 2015 * Leadership Lessons from Your Brain, Toastmasters District 77 Conference, October 2012 * How to Construct a Speech, Toastmasters District 77 Conference, October 2015 * How to Create An Effective Resume, Madison Job Networking Club, April 2013 * The Five Keys to a Successful Job Interview, Madison Job Networking Club, January 2015 * How to Make the Best Impression, Madison Job Networking Club, March 2016",

Rob has given a number of CodeMash talks during the OG years such as \"JRuby - Wonder Twin Powers, Activate!\", \"Ruby on Rails for Java Developers\" and \"FlexMock: We Don't Need No Stinkin' Objects!\" ... all bangers, I assure you! Rob has taught at DeVry University and Columbus State Community College along with numerous internal company classes. The languages have come and gone (and sometimes come back again!) but it has only been the Ruby language that has really given him that true joy of programming.

They’ve graced the stages of dev and test conferences, where they talk about risk-based testing, accessibility (because tech should work for literally everyone), and building agile teams that actually like working together. They’re also known for coaching and cheerleading the next generation of testers—because who else is going to keep the bugs in line? Off the clock, Jenna swaps bug hunts for mosh pits at punk rock shows and high-flying chaos at pro wrestling events with their husband, Bob. They’re also a frequent traveler, though their most important role is “human caretaker” to three feline overlords: Maka, Milton, and Excalipurr.",

      "description": "<p>CodeMash is a unique event that educates developers and tech adjacent workers on current practices, methodologies and technology trends in a variety of platforms and development languages. Held every January at the lush Kalahari Resort in Sandusky, Ohio, attendees will be able to attend a world-class technical conference amid the US's largest indoor waterpark. Nobody will frown if you show up in shorts, sandals, and your loudest t-shirt. You might even win a prize for doing so.</p><p><br></p><p>It’s not just about a grind of sessions, but also providing attendees the opportunity of continuing the conversations and networking outside of the daily conference events. The goal has always been to achieve this mission by creating a conference environment that focuses on professionalism and respect for one another.</p><p><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14px; color: rgb(17, 17, 17);\">CodeMash strives to motivate attendees through amazing speakers and incredible content. Previous speakers have included Mary Poppendeick, Scott Guthrie, Neal Ford, Scott Chacon, and Chad Fowler. Breakout sessions over the year have included everything from F# to JavaScript, mobile application development, career skills, software development processes, and so much more! There are also two days worth of hands-on workshops covering everything from test driven development to improving your communication skills to augment the two basic days of sessions.</span></p>",
